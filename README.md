Design and develop a responsive landing page that features an interactive navigation menu. This menu should dynamically change its color or style when the user scrolls down the page or hovers over any menu item. The navigation bar must be fixed in position, ensuring it stays visible across all sections of the page. Focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly layout that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Fixed and visible navigation menu on all pages
